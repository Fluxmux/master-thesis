This thesis could not have been written without the much appreciated help of other people.

I wish to show my gratitude to Toon Goedem{\'e} from Campus De Nayer, KU Leuven, for steering me in the right direction, assisting me during the study and for giving me useful feedback on my thesis. His assistance was a milestone in the completion of this thesis.

I would also like to pay my special regards to Pradip Mainali for helping me getting set up and giving me guidance. He got me intrigued with cryptography for which I am forever grateful. I admire his endless patience and I felt like the door was always open for when I had questions or when problems arose.

 I would also like to thank all the other experts at OneSpan whose assistance was greatly appreciated. In particular; Tom De Wasch, Fabien Petitcolas and Marc Joye and ofcourse the IT guys for solving the many technical difficulties that I encountered.

Finally I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, my sister and my friends. They encouraged me during the years to pursue my technical studies. They have always been there for me and I know that I can count on them.\\

Thank you

Felix Lerner
