\label{chapter:evaluation}

In this chapter we will take a look at the results of various experiments conducted during the process of making a secure CNN for face matching. First we describe our testing environment in order to make reproducable results. Then we move on by explaining our first experiment, secure image sharpening with convolutions. Then we will test each of the different layers of the network; convolution layer, subsampling layer and activation layer. Finally we discuss our obtained results of the whole secure CNN.
