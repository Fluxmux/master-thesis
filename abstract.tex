We are affected with machine learning in many aspects of our daily lives, applications ranges from facial recognition to enhanced healthcare to self-driving cars. Nowadays most of these neural networks are computed in the hardware of the client and the data stays clientside. As more and more companies move the backend processing serverside, because it's easier to debug and it's faster to roll out new updates. We see a rise in "questions about the privacy of our data". Would you want to have a picture of your face sent to a server everytime you want to unlock your phone with your face? Even if the company of said server promises they won't do anything other than run the neural network on the image of your face, there still exist the risk of them doing it anyway. So we need to find a method that bars the company of being able to have access to the picture of your face but give them enough access so they can process the image in the neural network.
