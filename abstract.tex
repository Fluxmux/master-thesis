We are affected with machine learning in many aspects of our daily lives, applications ranges from facial recognition to enhanced healthcare to self-driving vehicles. As companies outsource image classification tasks to cloud computing service providers, we see a rise in privacy concerns for both the users wishing to keep their data confidential, as for the company wishing to keep their classifier obfuscated.

We make use of existent cryptographic methods and state of the art computer vision algorithms to encrypt data in a way that an image classification task, like face matching, can be computed, while making sure that the privacy of the user is preserved.\\
