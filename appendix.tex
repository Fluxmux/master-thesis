There are two separate smaller projects:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Face matching}: This project includes the training, testing and design of the convolutional neural network used for face matching.
  \item \textbf{Secure face matching}: This project includes the different secure operations as well as the MPC set up and the binaries for transforming regular Docker containers to MPC parties.
\end{enumerate}

The first project can be found on the USB in the directory named \textit{facematching} or via \url{https://github.com/Fluxmux/facematching}. The second project can be found on the USB in the directory named \textit{securefacematching} or via \url{https://github.com/Fluxmux/securefacematching}.
