\chapter{Conclusion}
In this chapter we will provide and answer to our initial hypotheses from section \ref{chapter:hypothesis} with our knowledge of the literature study from chapter \ref{chapter:literature} and the results of chapter \ref{chapter:evaluation}. We will also provide hints to continue improving our work and in which directions we would look for future studies on this subject.

\section{Future Work}
We have arrived at the last section of this thesis. However, our work doesn't end here. This project offered an insight as to how a theoretical as well as practical implementation of a privacy-preserving, deep learning-based, facial matching algorithm using secure multiparty computation as means of encryption, works and how reliable the protocol is.\\

There are several improvements that can be done. As for one...
